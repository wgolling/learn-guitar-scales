## Learn Guitar Scales.

This app is being developed for the express purpose of helping me learn guitar scales, in particular different "modes". The idea behind a mode in music theory is that you take the standard Major scale, but just start on a diffenet note; for example the Aeolian mode, which starts on the 6-th note of the major scale, is the same scale as the relative Minor.

The app will quiz the user on a particular mode, and the user will have to press the buttons on the "fretboard" that correspond to notes in that mode. So far I have made the basic button layout in React, added clickability, worked out a rudimentary way of displaying modes on the fretboard, and added buttons for selecting the mode.
